Frontend for ACM Membership Platform

## Setup
Install the dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```

## Development
Make sure the backend is running first:

```bash
$ cd ..
$ make dev
```

Then run the webpack dev server:

```bash
$ make dev
```

You can access the website from `http://localhost:8000` and the app will communicate with the backend directly on port `8080`.

## Production
To run in production, follow the instructions for the `membership-portal` repository.
